to detect euler circuit in DG:
- count the indegrees and outdegrees of each node, there will exactly be 2 nodes which will have this-
- if(outdegree[node] - indegree[node] == 1) -> source
- if(indegree[node] - outdegree[node] == 1) -> destination
- all the other nodes have indegree[node] == outdegree[node]

* if its a eulerian circuit any node can be the starting point
